# Hello there, I'm Tim!

I'm a front-end developer who is passionate about making fast and user-friendly websites. I have previously worked for a rapidly growing e-commerce store and an automotive-focused marketing agency.

I also like to work on video game development in my spare time!

I currently work on [Rookie Kids](https://www.rookiekids.com/) as a software developer
